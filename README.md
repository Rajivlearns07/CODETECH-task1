## Overview of the Project 

### Project: Temperature Converter

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a console-based temperature converter that allows users to convert temperatures between four different scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine. The program will enhance the user's understanding of temperature conversions and improve their programming skills in C by utilizing various programming concepts such as input/output operations, conditional statements, and mathematical calculations.

### Key Activities
- **Design the User Interface**: Create a console menu that allows users to select the temperature scale they want to convert from and to, and prompt them to enter the temperature value.
- **Implement Conversion Functions**: Write separate functions for each temperature conversion formula (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.) to perform the calculations.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the program handles user inputs correctly by implementing checks for valid temperature values and scale selections to prevent errors.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Entire project is implemented using the C programming language, which allows for low-level control and efficient execution.
- **Console-based interface**: The program interacts with users through a console-based menu, prompting them to select temperature scales and enter values.
- **Mathematical calculations**: The program employs the necessary formulas to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine scales.
